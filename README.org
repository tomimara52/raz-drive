* Description
  A google-drive-type web application that lets you manage files in a remote storage.
  Back end in Laravel and connected to the React front end through Inertiajs.

* Installation

  Once downloaded run
  #+begin_src shell
    cp .env.example .env
  #+end_src
  and configure the database connection.
  
  Then
  #+begin_src shell
    composer install
    php artisan migrate
    php artisan key:generate
    npm install
    npm run build
    php artisan serve
  #+end_src
  and go to localhost:8000 to see the webpage.

  Note that there aren't routes to register a user, so you will have to add one manually to the database.
